hello! every body.
I think operators of the Rust is too less.
So, I am making a extension of operators crate for the Rust.
Thought it was not used by the Rust.
I provite some interfaces to allow more functions in the Rust.
Are you have some new idea or some suggest?
Tell me please.
Now is 0.0.2 version, so I only belive four functions(Increase, Decrease, Pop, Move).
Your cheer is my power that forward.
